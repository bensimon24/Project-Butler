		<h3>Insert quiz content here</h3><br>
		<p>I'm thinking of also adding a drop down menu from the top menu bar that includes a list of links to all quizzes<br>The footer should stick to the bottom after we 
			add more content.  I added another lighter color because all the colors we initially picked when put together were too dark.  Stuff blended into each other.  We can definitely
			pick different colors, just maybe similar shades of light/dark to this?<br><br>For ease of work I've only done some of the changes to the quiz 1 page and we can copy it to the 
			other pages if we like them.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
